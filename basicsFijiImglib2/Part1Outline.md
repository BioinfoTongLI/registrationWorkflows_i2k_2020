# Basics, Fiji, and imglib2

Students will learn to write code to do the operations below in imglib2, and how
to integrate that code into Fiji.

## Types of transformations

* Linear
    * Translation
    * Rigid
    * Similarity
    * Affine
* Non-linear
    * Displacement field
    * B-spline
    * Thin plate spline

We will not cover:
* Piecewise linear
* Elastic
* Fluid

but be aware that these exist.

## Operations on transformations

* Inverse transformations
* Concatenating / composing transformations
    * `interpolateOnceDemo.groovy`

## Transforming images and coordinates

* Transforming points 
* Transforming images
* Image metadata and working in physical coordinates
