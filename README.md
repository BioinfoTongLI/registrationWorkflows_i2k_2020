# Summary

Students will learn:
* The principals of image transformation and registration.
    * Types of transformations (similarity, affine, non-linear)
    * Displacement fields for non-linear transformations
    * Basics of imglib2 spatial transformations
* How to use [elastix](https://elastix.lumc.nl/) for automatic image registration
    * Parameter choices
    * Jacobian of a transformation to measure deformation
* How to use [BigWarp](https://imagej.net/BigWarp) to perform manual registration or to fine-tune an automatic registration.
    * concatenating transformations
    * converting transformations to convenient formats for use in different tools.

### Prerequisites 

Students should be familiar with ImageJ/Fiji, and understand basic image analysis concepts such as resampling and interpolation.
